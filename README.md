# 👋 Hi there, I'm Philip

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

After a few years in startup marketing, I found myself increasingly drawn to the technical side of things – data, automation, and figuring out how stuff works. That curiosity turned into a career shift.

I’m currently in a full-time, 12-month program to become a Python Backend Developer (DCI). My focus areas: Python, Django, SQL, and building useful things. I'm also expanding my skills in Data Analytics and Data Science on the side.

At the moment, I’m still early in the process – but new projects are on the way, and this space will fill up quickly.
