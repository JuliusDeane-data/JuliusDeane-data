# 👋 Hi there, I'm Philip

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

After a few years in startup marketing, I found myself increasingly drawn to the technical side of things – data, automation, and figuring out how stuff works. 
That curiosity led me to a career shift into software development.

I am now in the final stages of an intensive 12-month Python Backend Developer program. 
My focus has been on building robust, scalable applications with Python, Django, and SQL. 
I am actively seeking an entry-level backend developer position where I can contribute to a team and continue to grow my skills.

Language skills:
